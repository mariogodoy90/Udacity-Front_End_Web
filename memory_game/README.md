## How to play

The game consist of 16 cards arranged in a grid.
The deck is made up of 8 different pairs of cards, each card has different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the the grid with de symbol face down.
The game has just one rule: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match.

The player flip one card over to reveal the symbol, then turns over a second card trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol. If match both cards stay flipped over, if doesn't match both are flip face down.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
